# Overview

In partial fulfillment of the requirements in System Analysis and Design course for school year 2019-2020

## The Project

In most educational institutions the attendance is taken manually. It is not only
time consuming, but it is also not secure, unreliable, and the data can be easily
compromised. Some institutions are using punch card for attendance while this will be
difficult for employers to keep track of the large number of employees.

## Project Objectives

### General Objectives

The present attendance system would be changed to a computer application that
the employees would be logging in to clock in and clock out. Since the school year had
already started, the attendance noted before the creation of the program would be
encoded on the database to support the entire year of their attendance, that would be
passed on their yearly report. Time and attendance software system, organizes,
analyzes, and stores information about your employee hours.

### Specific Objectives

analyzes, and stores information about your employee hours.

## Scope and limitations

The user will log in to the system with the use of the program, then the program
will ask to input the user’s username and password. After log in the program will check
what type of log in was being logged in, if it is the “ADMIN” or “EMPLOYEE.” After
determining whose account is being used, the program will go to the designated
platform. If it is the admin user, then the user can check all the employee details, while
the employee users can only use time in and clock out system.
